JSONThing
=========
JsonThing is a proof of concept developed by Dustin Mundy to show C#s ability to read and manipulate data from various sources such a JSON, SQL and XML. It accomplishes this using nuget packages such as Newtonsoft JSON.Net and LINQ.

Simply run the program to see the resulting output from several different methods used to convert data from one format to another. This also includes LINQ methods of filtering and regrouping data.
